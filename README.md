# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study

## Overview
This contains well commented Jupyter Notebook, PPT, Subjective Question Answers, and a brief summary report

## Problem Statement
X Education company sell online courses to professionals and students. X Education needs help selecting the most promising leads, i.e., the leads most likely to convert into paying customers. Higher conversion of leads will lead to a higher revenue

## Algorithm
To solve this classification problem we have used the Logistic Regression Algorithm

## Approach
  1. Data Importing
  2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis - Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
  4. Model Building
  5. Conclusion
  6. Recommendations

## Model Selection Criteria
  1. p-value < 0.05 and Variance Inflation Factor < 5.5 are acceptable
  2. Feature Scaling performed using Standard Scaler
  3. Feature selection is performed using automated (RFE) and manual elimination process
